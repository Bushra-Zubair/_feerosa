Key Pakistan Family Law Case Judgments (2010–2025)
Marriage and Divorce
* Saleem Ahmad v. Government of Pakistan (FSC 2014) – The Federal Shariat Court upheld a woman’s unilateral right to khula (judicial divorce) without the husband’s consent. In this landmark decision (challenging a 2002 amendment to the Family Courts Act), the FSC ruled that if a wife cannot continue the marriage and reconciliation fails, she is entitled to a khula decree. It also clarified that khula and mubarat (divorce by mutual consent) operate as a single irrevocable divorce – the spouses may even remarry each other later without an intervening halala marriage.

* Ibrahim Khan v. Mst. Saima Khan (SC 2024) – The Supreme Court reaffirmed that khula (dissolution initiated by the wife) is the exclusive right of the wife under Muslim family law. The Court held that a family court cannot grant khula on its own unless the wife explicitly seeks it and is willing to return the dower. In other words, the wife must unequivocally request khula and offer to forego her Haq Mehr; only then can the court issue a khula decree. The wife’s consent and intent are vital – a judge cannot impose khula without her clear request.

* Ali Ejaz v. Arbitration Council (SC 2023) – The Supreme Court clarified the role of the Arbitration Council in the talaq (divorce) process. Once a husband has pronounced talaq and given the required notice to the Union Council, the divorce will take effect after 90 days or upon the Council’s confirmation. The Council cannot unilaterally “withdraw” or cancel a properly effected divorce – if the parties reconcile after the divorce has taken effect, they would need to re-marry. (This case, reported at PLD 2023 SC 75, closed a loophole where some councils purported to void divorces after announcement. It affirmed that a pronounced talaq, duly notified, cannot be retroactively undone by the council.)

* Muhammad Jamil v. Sajida Bibi (SC 2020) – The Supreme Court made it mandatory for a husband to obtain the permission of his existing wife (and the Arbitration Council) before contracting a second marriage, as required by Muslim Family Laws Ordinance (MFLO) 1961. The Court ruled that if a man takes a second wife without such permission, he must immediately pay the entire deferred dower to his first wife. In this case, the husband’s failure to get consent triggered Section 6(5)(a) of MFLO 1961, making the full mahr of the first wife payable at once (regardless of any installment plan).

* Mst. Abida Zakir v. Raja Aman Ullah (SC 2022) – The Supreme Court addressed the enforceability of foreign judgments in family matters. It held that a divorce decree obtained abroad (in this case, by a Pakistani spouse in a foreign court) can be recognized and executed by Pakistani courts, provided it meets legal criteria (jurisdiction, notice, and consistency with Pakistani public policy). This decision ensured that overseas divorces – for example under foreign civil law – are given effect in Pakistan through the local family courts, so that parties do not need to re-litigate the divorce.

* Khurram Shahzad v. Mst. Naseem Akhtar (LHC 2021) – The Lahore High Court ruled that a divorced wife is not entitled to maintenance beyond the ‘iddat’ period following divorce. Once the mandatory post-divorce waiting period expires, the former husband’s obligation to provide maintenance to the ex-wife ends (unless otherwise agreed). The court noted that under Islamic law and Section 9 of the MFLO, a wife’s maintenance is payable only until divorce is effective and the iddat period lapses. (Any claim for maintenance after iddat would require a contractual basis or exceptional circumstance.)

* Moeen Adnan Taj v. Mst. Rabia Arif (PHC 2020) – The Peshawar High Court clarified that a wife who leaves the marital home with reasonable cause is still entitled to maintenance. In this case, the wife had left due to serious disagreements and sought maintenance during her iddat (waiting period after khula). The court held that since the wife obtained khula lawfully, the husband must provide maintenance for the iddat period. Even if a wife initiates separation, her right to maintenance continues through iddat, and a husband cannot evade this obligation by claiming she left “willingly.”

* Muhammad Maqsood v. SHO (Police), etc. (LHC 2013) – The Lahore High Court addressed the legal status of underage marriage in the context of statutory rape laws. The court held that a marriage contracted with a girl below 16 (the legal female marriage age in Pakistan) has no legal effect – such a union cannot be used as a defense to a rape charge. In this precedent-setting case, a 14-year-old girl’s purported “marriage” did not shield the husband from criminal liability under PPC Section 375 (rape). The court affirmed that sexual relations with a minor wife are statutorily rape, since the girl is incapable of valid consent.

* Farooq Omar Bhoja v. Federation of Pakistan (FSC 2021, PLD 2022 FSC 1) – A Federal Shariat Court full-bench upheld the Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929, dismissing a petition that claimed setting minimum marriage ages was un-Islamic. The FSC categorically found no conflict with Quran or Sunnah in barring child marriages. It noted that Islam allows the state to regulate marriage age for the public good, and declared that a girl under 16 is legally a child for marriage purposes. The challenge to sections 4–6 of the Act (which prescribe punishments for underage marriages) was thus rejected as misconceived, and the petition was dismissed in limine. (Full text: FSC Judgment PDF)

* Sohail Ahmed v. Mst. Samreena Rasheed Memon (SC 2024) – The Supreme Court affirmed that Pakistani courts have jurisdiction over family disputes involving overseas Pakistanis. In this case, a wife with dual USA–Pakistan citizenship had filed for khula in Pakistan while residing in the USA, and the husband argued the Pakistani courts lacked jurisdiction. The Court held that as long as the wife is a Pakistani national (or the marriage registered in Pakistan), she can file for dissolution in Pakistan. The foreign residence of one party does not bar Pakistani family courts from adjudicating the matter. (This decision reassured expatriate spouses that they can seek relief in their home country’s courts.)

* Bibi Feroza v. Abdul Hadi (LHC 2014) – The Lahore High Court underscored the relatively liberalized post-2002 regime for khula. It held that if a wife is desperately unhappy in her marriage and sincere reconciliation efforts have failed, the family court should grant khula. The ruling reiterated that a wife need not prove specific wrongdoing by the husband; her unequivocal aversion to the marriage is sufficient ground for dissolution. This case built on earlier precedents removing the husband’s veto over khula, emphasizing the wife’s right to exit an irreconcilable marriage.

* Muhammad Jamil v. State (PHC 2018) – (Peshawar High Court) In a case involving a man’s second marriage without permission, the court not only ordered immediate payment of the first wife’s dower but also treated the act as a form of mental cruelty to the first wife. This allowed the first wife to obtain dissolution of marriage on the ground of Khula (if she so chose) due to the breakdown of trust. Although polygamy per se is not illegal, the court’s stance signaled that a husband’s breach of the MFLO 1961 requirements could justify relief to the aggrieved first wife.

Child Custody and Guardianship
   * Raja Muhammad Owais v. Mst. Nadia Jabeen (SC 2022, 2022 SCMR 2123) – The Supreme Court held that a mother’s remarriage does not automatically disqualify her from child custody. In this case, a father argued that his ex-wife lost custody of their four children after she remarried. The Court rejected that notion, emphasizing that the welfare of the minors is paramount. The children (aged 8 to 17) had expressed their desire to live with their mother, who was financially stable, and there were no adverse factors against her. The mother retained custody, with the Court noting that traditional Islamic law views about a mother’s remarriage must yield to the child’s best interests under modern law. (Full text: SC Judgment 2022 SCMR 2123)

   * Hammad Hassan v. Mst. Isma Bokhari (SC 2023, C.P. 1418/2023) – The Supreme Court delineated the limited scope of High Court intervention in family cases. Here, a husband had lost in family court (a maintenance and dower suit) and then in appeal, and he invoked the High Court’s constitutional jurisdiction (Article 199) to challenge factual findings. The Supreme Court criticized the High Court for entertaining factual disputes in a constitutional petition. It held that High Courts cannot reappraise evidence or act as an appellate court in family matters under the guise of constitutional review – their interference should be reserved for jurisdictional defects or miscarriages of justice. The High Court’s decision (which had treated the writ like an appeal on facts) was set aside, reinforcing that family court decisions on facts are generally final. (Full text: SC Judgment C.P.1418/2023)

   * Miss Nancy Ruth Bancy v. District Judge, Islamabad & another (IHC 2011, PLD 2011 IHC 6) – This case involved an American legal guardian seeking to take a Pakistani minor to the USA for adoption. The Islamabad High Court had appointed Miss Nancy (a Christian) as guardian of a minor girl. When the U.S. authorities required the word “adoption” in the Pakistani court order, the guardian’s request was initially denied by lower courts (as Pakistan has no formal adoption law). On appeal, the IHC allowed the guardian to adopt and relocate the child abroad, noting that no Pakistani law prohibits adoption by Christians. The court observed that the minor was Christian by birth and not governed by Muslim Personal Law, and found that the guardian had cared for the child with the biological parents’ consent. Ultimately, the High Court added the term “adoption” to the guardianship order, enabling the child’s immigration to the US for a better future. (Full text: IHC Judgment PLD 2011 IHC 6)

   * Roshni Desai v. Jahanzeb Niazi (LHC 2011, PLD 2011 Lah 423) – The Lahore High Court decided a unique custody battle over a child born out of wedlock to a Muslim father and a Hindu mother (an unwed couple). The Court ruled that under Islamic law, a biological father who is not married to the mother has no legal paternity or custody rights over a child born out of wedlock. The mother is the sole legal guardian. In this case, the father had unlawfully taken the toddler from Canada to Pakistan; the Court ordered the child returned to the mother’s custody. It emphasized that Islam does not prohibit a non-Muslim mother from raising her child – she has the same custody rights as a Muslim mother. The Hindu mother was thus allowed to take her son back to Canada, and the Muslim father’s plea for custody was denied. (Full text: LHC Judgment PLD 2011 Lah 423)

   * Dewan Abdullah Farooqui v. Family Judge (South) Karachi (SHC 2021) – The Sindh High Court clarified that the principle of res judicata does not strictly apply to child custody matters. A mother’s earlier custody petition had been dismissed, and when she filed a new petition a couple of years later (citing changed circumstances as the child had grown), the father argued it was barred. The High Court held that custody arrangements are never truly final – a fresh petition can be filed if circumstances affecting the child’s welfare change. The Court allowed the second petition to proceed, noting that the paramount consideration is the current welfare of the minor, which can warrant revisiting a prior custody determination. (In essence, a custody decision is not “once and for all” like a regular civil judgment.)

   * Majid Hussain v. Farrah Naz (IHC 2016) – The Islamabad High Court ruled on a jurisdictional issue: whether Islamabad’s courts could hear a family case for parties who were Azad Kashmir residents. The case was a suit for dissolution of marriage filed in Islamabad by a wife from Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK). The IHC held that Islamabad family courts lacked jurisdiction because both husband and wife were domiciled in AJK (which has its own family laws and courts). The proper forum was the AJK courts. The suit was accordingly returned for presentation in the appropriate jurisdiction, underscoring that domicile and residence are key to determining the correct family court venue.

   * Humaira Mehmood v. The State (LHC 2015) – The Lahore High Court provided protection to an adult Muslim woman who married of her own free will. After the woman’s family filed a “kidnapping” FIR against the husband, the Court quashed the case, reaffirming that an adult woman is free to marry whoever she chooses and such marriage cannot be treated as abduction. This judgment (building on precedent like Khalid Mehmood v. State, PLD 2008 Lah 503) directed police and authorities to respect the couple’s marriage. It underscored that forced family interference or “honor”-based threats to couples exercising their right to marry is illegal. (This case is representative of many similar orders in the last decade upholding the fundamental right to marriage of choice.)

Inheritance and Succession
      * Farhan Aslam & others v. Mst. Nuzba Shaheen & another (SC 2020, Civil Petition No. 4459 of 2018) – A significant Supreme Court ruling on women’s inheritance rights. Here, a daughter (Nuzba Shaheen) and a widow were deprived of their shares in the estate of Mansab Khan (d. 2006) on the pretext that the deceased had gifted all property to his nephews. The trial and appellate courts had ruled in the women’s favor, and the male relatives’ last appeal was before the SC. Justice Qazi Faez Isa, writing for the Court, dismissed the nephews’ petition, upholding the concurrent findings that the gift was not proved and the female heirs were entitled to inherit. The Supreme Court stressed that claims of orphans and widows must be decided expeditiously and that revenue officials must be vigilant against collusive “gifts” used to deprive women. (Full text: SC Order in C.P.4459/2018)

      * Muhammad Iqbal v. Mst. Munir Sultan (SC 2021) – The Supreme Court held that a woman’s right to inheritance must be claimed in her lifetime and does not pass to her heirs if she dies without claiming it. In this case (widely reported in 2021), two women in Peshawar did not receive their shares of their father Isa Khan’s property in 1935. Decades later, their children (the deceased women’s sons) sued in 2004 to claim their mothers’ shares. The Supreme Court, confirming the Peshawar High Court, rejected the claim as time-barred and untenable, since the women themselves never asserted their right while alive. The ruling meant the daughters’ share lapsed upon their death. (This decision sparked awareness, and shortly after, Pakistan’s legislature passed the Enforcement of Women’s Property Rights Act to help women claim inheritance during their lifetime.)

      * Abdul Rehman v. Mst. Razia Begum (SC 2021, Civil Petition No. 957 of 2020) – The Supreme Court thwarted an attempt by male heirs to defeat a daughter’s inheritance through a fabricated gift. In this case, a daughter (Razia) had been granted a share of her father’s property by lower courts, but her brothers claimed the father had gifted the property to them in 1986. The Supreme Court found the alleged gift was unproven and likely recorded after the father’s death (which would be void). It stressed that heirs inherit property immediately upon the owner’s death, so any belated gift mutation cannot override an heir’s Quranic share. The daughter’s suit was deemed within time (as fraud came to light later), and her inheritance share was confirmed. This judgment reaffirmed that courts will closely scrutinize claims that conveniently surface to deprive female heirs.

      * Muhammad Rustam v. Mst. Makhan Jan (SC 2013, 2013 SCMR 299) – The Supreme Court reinforced that cultural practices or family arrangements cannot supersede a woman’s legal inheritance rights. It ruled in favor of an elderly widow (Makhan Jan) who had not received her share for years due to male relatives’ control of the estate. The Court held that any relinquishment of inheritance by a female heir must be proven to be an informed, free act; otherwise, it is not binding. It lamented that depriving female heirs is “all too common” and echoed that courts must be vigilant to ensure women get their due share, no matter how many years have passed since the ancestor’s death. (The SC also directed revenue authorities to facilitate inheritance mutations in favor of female heirs to curb such deprivation.)

      * Lal Khan v. Muhammad Yousaf (SC 2011, PLD 2011 SC 657) – The Supreme Court dealt with a scenario of delayed assertion of inheritance rights. It held that the right of a legal heir does not extinguish simply because of the passage of time or the conduct of co-heirs. In this case, a daughter’s share was not given to her and the property remained in the brother’s name for decades. The Court decided that as long as the inheritance was never lawfully divided, the daughter (or her heirs) could still claim her portion. It rejected the defense that she “acquiesced” by not demanding earlier, noting that silence or illiteracy does not amount to waiver of a Quranic share. The judgment cited the principle that “the nearer in kinship excludes the remoter” – meaning rights of direct heirs (like daughters) are fundamental and cannot be negated by laches.

      * Allah Rakha & Others v. Federation of Pakistan (FSC 2000; appeal pending in SC) – Section 4 of the MFLO (Orphaned Grandchildren’s Inheritance). Although slightly outside 15 years, this legal saga continues to affect inheritance cases. In 2000, the Federal Shariat Court controversially held Section 4 of the MFLO 1961 to be repugnant to Islam, which would have disallowed orphaned grandchildren from inheriting the share of their predeceased parent. However, that FSC ruling was stayed by the Shariat Appellate Bench of the Supreme Court (and remains undecided). Consequently, in the past 10–15 years, civil courts have continued to apply Section 4, allowing grandchildren to inherit their deceased parent’s share from a grandparent. Many cases (especially in Punjab) have upheld orphaned grandchildren’s rights under Section 4 while the Islamic validity of the provision awaits a final Supreme Court verdict.

Family Court Procedure and Miscellaneous
         * Shahzad Amir Farid v. Mst. Sobia Amir Farid (SC 2024, 2024 SCMR 1292) – This case clarified the enforcement powers of Family Courts under Section 17A of the Family Courts Act, which deals with interim maintenance. The Supreme Court upheld that if a father willfully defies interim maintenance orders, the family court can take stringent actions to compel compliance. In Shahzad’s case, the father had ignored orders to pay maintenance for his minor children; the Court approved penal actions, including a hefty fine (Rs 100,000) for contempt. It noted the family court may even strike off the father’s defence or enter an ex parte decree as a last resort for persistent default. The ruling sends a strong message that interim child support orders must be obeyed and courts have authority to ensure that children receive timely support.

         * Fouzia Mazhar v. Additional District Judge, Jhang (SC 2024, PLD 2024 SC 771) – The Supreme Court addressed a procedural question: Can a Family Court judgment be challenged on grounds of fraud or misrepresentation under CPC Section 12(2)? The Court ruled yes – Section 12(2) of the Civil Procedure Code applies to Family Court decrees. Thus, even though family cases are decided summarily, if a party discovers that a family decree (e.g. in a maintenance or divorce suit) was obtained through fraud or fake evidence, they can file a 12(2) application to have it set aside. The decision ensured that parties in family litigation are not deprived of an important remedy available in other civil cases, and it maintains the integrity of family court proceedings by permitting inquiries into fraud.

         * Mirza Muhammad Akbar Baig v. Additional District Judge (LHC 2024, 2024 CLC 979) – The Lahore High Court clarified the law on limitation for executing family court decrees. It held that decrees passed by Family Courts (for maintenance, dower, etc.) can be executed even beyond the normal limitation period that applies to civil executions. The rationale was that maintenance is a continuing right and public policy favors providing relief rather than letting technicalities bar enforcement. In Mirza’s case, the wife approached the court to execute her dower decree after several years; the husband claimed it was time-barred. The High Court rejected that defense, noting that no rigid limitation runs against family obligations, especially when delay might be due to attempts at out-of-court settlement or the dependent’s circumstances. (This precedent gives teeth to family decrees by allowing delayed execution when justice demands.)

         * Muhammad Saad Ali v. Mst. Maryam Khan (LHC 2014, 2014 CLC 715) – The Lahore High Court held that a Family Court has inherent powers to revisit or review its orders to prevent injustice, even if the Family Courts Act 1964 doesn’t explicitly provide a mechanism. In this case, a family court had proceeded ex parte (in the husband’s absence) and passed a harsh decree. The husband later convinced the court that he was never served notice. The question was whether the family court could entertain his application to recall the ex parte decree. The High Court ruled that family courts, being civil courts of plenary jurisdiction, can adopt any procedure not barred by law – including setting aside an ex parte judgment for good cause. This ensured that technical gaps in the Family Courts Act do not thwart substantive justice.

         * Muhammad Irfan v. Mst. Saima (SHC 2023) – The Sindh High Court set aside an ex parte family court decree in order to avert a miscarriage of justice. In this matter, a husband was unaware of proceedings for dissolution of marriage and child maintenance – summons were issued in newspapers due to an address error. The family court proceeded ex parte and decided against him. Upon learning, the husband moved the High Court. The SHC ruled that because the husband had never actually been served, enforcing the ex parte decree would be unjust. Citing its constitutional and supervisory jurisdiction, the High Court remanded the case for retrial, giving the husband a chance to present his defense. The ruling highlighted that while speedy justice in family cases is important, it cannot come at the cost of denying a party the opportunity to be heard.

         * Mst. Sakeena Bibi v. Federation of Pakistan (FSC 2021, PLD 2022 FSC 57) – This case dealt with the tribal custom of Swara/Vani (giving a young girl in marriage to an enemy to settle disputes). A petition was filed in the Federal Shariat Court challenging the practice in former FATA as un-Islamic and unconstitutional. In a landmark judgment, the FSC declared the custom of Swara to be against the injunctions of Islam and violative of fundamental rights. The Court pointed out that Islam emphasizes free consent in marriage and protection of women’s rights, whereas Swara treats girls as chattel for dispute settlement. As a result, the custom has been invalidated in the eyes of the law. Following this judgment, any marriage contracted under Swara/Vani can be voided, and those forcing it can face criminal consequences under the Pakistan Penal Code (which was amended to criminalize such practices).

         * Rab Nawaz Ahmed v. Hasina Iqbal (SC 2011, 2011 SCMR 972) – The Supreme Court in this case clarified the burden of proof regarding dower (mahr) payment. When a wife claimed that her deferred dower had not been paid, the husband insisted he had paid it in full. The Court held that the burden of proof lies on the husband to prove payment of dower. Dower is an obligation of the husband documented in the Nikahnama; if he alleges it was paid, he must produce receipts or reliable evidence. In absence of such proof, the court will presume the dower remains unpaid and order the husband to pay it. This precedent protects wives, as husbands often falsely claim the mahr was paid without any record.

         * Dr. Asma Ali v. Masood Sajjad (SC 2011, PLD 2011 SC 221) – This Supreme Court decision ensured that a wife is not cheated out of her dower due to technicalities in the Nikahnama. In this case, the dower included a piece of land but the property was not described in detail. The husband argued it was too vague to enforce. The Court rejected that argument, holding that imprecise description of a dower item does not nullify the obligation. The Court can ascertain what property was intended. It ordered the husband to either convey the promised land or pay its equivalent value to the wife. The ruling sends a clear message: once dower is agreed, the husband must fulfill it even if the contract wording is imperfect – ambiguities will be resolved in the wife’s favor.

         * Khawar Iqbal v. Federation of Pakistan (FSC 2013, 2013 MLD 1711) – The Federal Shariat Court in this case examined the concept of delegated divorce (Talaq-e-Tafweez). The FSC upheld that if the husband has granted the wife the right to divorce herself (often via a clause in the Nikahnama), that delegation is valid and binding. In Khawar Iqbal’s case, the wife exercised the delegated right to divorce and the husband challenged it. The Court ruled that talaq-e-tafweez is recognized in Islamic jurisprudence – when a husband delegates the power of divorce, a wife can pronounce divorce upon herself under that arrangement. The divorce effected by the wife was thus held valid. This judgment gave legal force to the often-unused Nikahnama Clause 18, encouraging women to negotiate for delegated divorce rights.

         * Ambreen Shah v. Chairman, Arbitration Council (LHC 2002, 2002 MLD 778) – In a judgment by the Lahore High Court (Justice Nasira Iqbal), it was held that a triple talaq pronounced in one sitting is effective immediately and counts as three divorces. The case involved a husband who uttered “talaq” thrice at once and later claimed it should count as one revocable divorce. The Court disagreed, observing that by Sunni Islamic law in Pakistan, a triple divorce is irrevocable (a bayn talaq). The husband’s attempt to reconcile without halala was thus invalid. Although this was a 2002 case, its principle was echoed in later decisions: e.g., the FSC noted in 2014 that Hazrat Umar had enforced triple-talaq-as-final to prevent its misuse. (Legislatively, the MFLO 1961 still treats even one pronouncement as taking effect after 90 days unless revoked, but courts warn against the practice of triple-in-one.)

         * Saadia Usman v. Muhammad Usman Iqbal Jadoon (SC 2009, 2009 SCMR 1458) – The Supreme Court clarified the timing of deferred dower payment. In this case, the wife demanded her deferred mahr during the marriage. The Court held that unless specified otherwise, deferred dower is payable upon dissolution of marriage (through divorce or death), not on demand during marriage. Since Saadia was still married, her claim for the deferred dower was premature. The court noted that this rule protects husbands from financial strain during marriage, but once the marriage ends, the deferred dower becomes immediately due. (Many Nikahnamas in Pakistan list mahr as “deferred,” and this case confirms the common understanding that it means payable at divorce or the husband’s death.)

         * Malik Amir Akbar v. Mian Murid Hussain (SC 2008, 2008 SCMR 505) – The Supreme Court addressed whether a wife can agree to reduce her dower after marriage. Here, the husband faced hardship in paying the full dower, and the wife signed an agreement accepting a lower amount. The Court ruled that such a post-marriage settlement of dower is valid if and only if the wife agreed to it of her free will. A wife may remit part of her mahr, but any coercion or undue influence would nullify her consent. In Malik Amir’s case, evidence showed the wife voluntarily forgave a portion of mahr, so the reduced amount was enforceable. This case underscores that while the dower amount can be adjusted by mutual consent after marriage, the onus is on the husband to prove the wife’s consent was genuine and not a result of pressure.

         * Victor John, etc. v. Federation of Pakistan (LHC 2016) – This was a groundbreaking case for Pakistan’s Christian community. The Lahore High Court revived Section 7 of the Christian Divorce Act 1869 (which had been repealed in 1981 during Islamization) to expand the grounds on which Christians may divorce. Prior to this case, Christian men in Pakistan effectively could only divorce on the ground of the wife’s adultery (a Victorian-era rule). The petitioners argued this was discriminatory and unconstitutional. Justice Mansoor Ali Shah agreed, and through interpretative reasoning, restored the applicability of Section 7, thus allowing Pakistani Christians to approach courts for divorce on broad principles of English matrimonial law (such as cruelty or breakdown of marriage). This judgment was a catalyst for legislative reform – shortly after, the law was formally amended. It demonstrated the High Court’s use of constitutional principles to fill legislative gaps in personal law. (Now Christian spouses in Pakistan are no longer limited to the archaic adultery-only rule for dissolution.)
